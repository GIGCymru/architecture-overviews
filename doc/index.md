# GIG Cymru - NHS Wales - Architecture Overviews

An Architecture Overview is a concise, structured artefact used to capture and communicate the essential aspects of a solution’s architecture. It supersedes the traditional Solution Architecture Document (SAD), which was frequently lengthy, difficult to review, and prone to becoming obsolete once delivery commenced.

The Architecture Overview is based on the internationally recognised arc42 framework and provides:

* Comprehensive structure – addressing context, constraints, quality attributes, building blocks, runtime perspectives, and architectural decisions.

* **Decision traceability** – through integration with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), ensuring that rationale is preserved alongside design outputs.

* **Methodology and technology neutrality** – applicable across waterfall, agile, or hybrid delivery approaches without imposing a specific stack.

* **Collaborative maintenance** – enabling contributions from multiple disciplines to ensure documentation remains accurate and current.

* **Improved assurance** – by presenting a clear and consistent format that facilitates peer review and governance.

* **AI compatibility** – the structured template is readily interpretable by AI tools, supporting automation in documentation generation and validation.

In summary, an AO constitutes a living document that provides an authoritative, end-to-end view of architectural design. It is deliberately concise, standardised, and continuously maintained to support both delivery and governance throughout the lifecycle of a product or service.

## Getting started

1. For an overview of the format of an AO, [arc42.org](https://arc42.org/overview/) will provide all the guidance you'll need.

2. For more details on DHCW tooling requirements, please AO Requirements section.
